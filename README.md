# Machine Learning Problem Bible (MLPB)

## Overview

MLPB is meant to become an organized collection of machine learning problems and solutions.  

In practice, machine learning often goes like this

> *I have this problem... I need to classify something as A, B or C using a combination of numeric and categorical features.  If I could find a similar problem, maybe I could modify the solution to work for my needs.*

This is where MLPB steps in.  Want to see ML problems with sparse data?  Got it.  Want to compare Scikit-learn’s RandomForestRegressor with R’s randomForest?  No problem.  Need an example of predicting a ranked target variable?  You’ve come to the right place.
